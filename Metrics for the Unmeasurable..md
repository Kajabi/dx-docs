### Highlights

- a good metric of organizational performance:

It should expose enough gradations to detect changes in performance over time,

**::changes across gradations should guide useful action,::**

**::they should be evaluable with limited context, and::**

**they should be sufficiently broad to abstract significant complexity.**

**At this point, I don't think there is a natural security metric that has these properties, but fortunately we don't have to rely on natural metrics. ::My approach lately has been creating synthetic metrics, which package input metrics into a useful abstraction.::**

**A good example of this is if you imagine creating a "server security grade", where you assign every server a letter grade from "A" to "F" based on its input metrics. The particulars are a bit orthogonal here, but perhaps a server with an "A" security grade would be less than seven days old, running the latest operating system, and have very limited root access. Each day you'd assess a security grade to every server, and then you would be able to start tracking the distribution of servers across letter grades.**
