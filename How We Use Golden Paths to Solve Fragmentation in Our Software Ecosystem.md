### Highlights

- One main purpose
- It is really important to know and communicate the purpose of the tutorials. One of the mistakes that we made was losing sight of this purpose. Engineers (and me and my team for that matter) started to ask: What are they? Are they a how-to guide? Are they to show best practice? Are they for education? Are they a reference? Are they all of the above?
- I was really struggling with this question. Initially, I settled on: “They are for new hires. And they show how we do things at Spotify.” This was my go-to description, but for some reason, it didn’t sit right. And others didn’t seem to be picking it up. Then, just recently, I spotted how another product manager at Spotify had described the Golden Path and tutorial. It went something like: “The Golden Path is the opinionated and supported path to build your system and the Golden Path tutorial walks you through this path.” Bingo, that was it. I shared it with some others, and got a bunch of thumbs up. This is exactly what we needed. We have our main purpose.
- Golden State
- Recently we have been exploring around the concept of what we call a Golden State. A Golden State is a list of checks that engineers can use to know if their systems are following the Golden Path. The ambitious end goal of Golden State is to get most of our engineering organisation to be on the Golden Path. In this way, we reduce the amount of fragmentation in our tech ecosystem – which helps teams lower their maintenance costs. Also, more people using the same thing equates to a higher likelihood that we can automatically upgrade them. And teams definitely want that.
