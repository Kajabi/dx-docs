### Highlights

- **Finally, ::the one thing I've found at companies with very few interrupts and almost nowhere else: really great, consistently available documentation.:: It's probably even harder to bootstrap documentation into a non-documenting company than it is to bootstrap unittests into a non-testing company, but the best solution to frequent interruptions I've seen is a culture of documentation, documentation reading, and a documentation search that actually works.**

- There are a non-zero number of companies which do internal documentation well, but I'm less sure if there are a non-zero number of companies with more than twenty engineers who do this well. If you know any, please let me know so I can pick their brains.
